# Remove .DS_Store

This is a program which removes all .DS_Store files in a directory and its subdirectories.

## How to use it:

Open code.py and do the following steps:

* change the variable 'path' to the path from this directory to the directory in which you want to remove all .DS_Store files

* change the variable 'see_noEnding_message' to False if you don't want to see messages if files don't have an ending (like .py)

* if you didn't change 'see_noEnding_message' to False, then you should add file endings you're using to 'file_endings'

After that you can just run code.py to remove all the .DS_Store files.

*WATCH OUT: You have to cd to remove-ds_stores first and then run
code.py bacause otherwise the path to your projects directory is wrong*
